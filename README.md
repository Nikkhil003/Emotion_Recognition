Emotion Recognition using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)
-
This project aims to recognize emotions from facial expressions using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) implemented in TensorFlow. The model achieves an 85% accuracy on the validation dataset by fine-tuning and optimizing hyperparameters. This project demonstrates the application of deep learning techniques for real-world tasks such as sentiment analysis and human-computer interaction.
